# Power-BI
Power BI Projects

In this project I worked with an open source dataset from an online survey of data professionals to create a PowerBI report. The report showcases interesting information such as average salary by job title, happiness with work/life balance and more that can be found in the dataset. The visualization presents the data in a clean and easy to read report.
